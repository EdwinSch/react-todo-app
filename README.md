## ToDo App (React)

Besides all the basic functions like posting, deleting and marking items, there are also filter functionalities and color modes included. It utilizes local storage to store items and changes on the list and the brand new native CSS nesting for styling.

Showcasing: CRUD functions, local storage handling, global context, mapping and filtering, data/state handling, dynamic styling and light/dark modes.

_Disclaimer: Yes, I know ToDo lists are the most common and not creative portfolio projects. But, I have yet to come across another type of app which shows understanding of CRUD in the front-end as good as a ToDo list does._
